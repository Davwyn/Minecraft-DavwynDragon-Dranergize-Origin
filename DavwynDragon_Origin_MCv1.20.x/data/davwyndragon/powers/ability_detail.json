	"description": "\n§fThis is a alternate species of dragon with plasma and starwisp abilities. Based heavily on the FutaraDragon Origin.§r\n\n§c§l§nDavywn Murrper Variant Changes§r\n\n§c§l§nInitial Experience\n§fYou start with 10 levels of experience, enough to unlock your first ability.§r\n\n§c§l§nStarwisps§r\n§fDavwyn's Starwisps are less agressive than Futara's Energy Orbs. They do not attack most friendly or passive mobs, or mobs you've applied a name tag to. They will however attack angered mobs. They also come in a range of colours and will briefly light targets on fire.\n\n§c§l§nCarnivore§r\n§fYou can only eat meat be it cooked or raw. Raw meat is almost as good as cooked in most cases.§r\n\n§c§l§nDigging Claws§r\n§fYou can dig through soft ores, stone, sand, and dirt with your claws as if you had stone tools with your empty paws.§r\n\n§c§l§nLimited Manipulators§r\n§fYou have paws and a maw which limit your ability to wield weapons. You can't swing swords or use ranged weapons.§r\n\n§c§l§nHunger Usage§r\n§fActivities like running, jumping, and special moves that use stamina all affect your hunger.§r\n\n§c§l§nHunger Effect Immune§r\n§fYou have an resiliant stomach. Poisonous food can't give you the 'Hunger' effect.§r\n\n§c§l§nNatural Exhustion§r\n§fBeyond using up all of your stamina, running, jumping, and other activities use up your hunger bar. You'll need to eat more often when very active.§r\n\n§c§l§nFall Immune§r\n§fYour wings protect you from any fall damage, even if you haven't unlocked flight yet.§r\n\n§c§l§nSneak to Climb§r\n§fOnce you unlock ability to climb, you need to hold the Sneak key to climb on walls.§r\n\n§c§l§nNo Horde Party§r\n§fHorde Party from FutaraDragon race is removed. No surprise monsters appear.§r\n\n§c§l§nCrystal Harvest§r\n§fYour starwisp abilities allow you to convert sand into crystal.\nEither put sand on your back (Offhand), Sneak and click the 'Place' button while looking into empty space, or have someone else 'Sneak' while they 'Place' sand on you to in the order of likelihood harvest glass, tinted glass, amethyst, or quartz at random.\n\n§c§l§nStarwisp Dust§r\n§fYour scales are covered in soft glowing starwisp dust which can be collected.\nEither put an empty bottle on your back (Offhand), Sneak and click the 'Place' button while looking into empty space, or have someone else 'Sneak' while they 'Use' an empty bottle on you to harvest this dust into the bottle. The dust when used grants temporary night-vision by making user glow.§r\n\n§c§l§nLow-Light Vision§r\n§fIn darkness your eyes will adjust giving you full night-vision. This farther expands on FutaraDragon Energy Eyes.§r\n\n§c§l§nGlowing§r\n§fBecause of the starwisp dust on your scales you always give off a soft light.§r\n\n§c§l§nSlightly shorter§r\n§fYou're slightly smaller than a human.\n(Requires Pehkui mod).§r\n\n§c§l§nPlasma Beam§r\n§fDavwyn's Plasma Beam is essentially identical to Futara's Hyper-Beam other than the sound it makes.§r\n\n§c§l§nPlasma Blast§r\n§fDavwyn's powers are plasma-based. Futara's Plasma Blast is renamed to Plasma Blast.§r\n\n§c§l§nPlasma Bolt§r\n§fDavwyn's powers are plasma-based. Futara's Energy Shot is renamed to Plasma Bolt.§r\n\n§c§l§nMurrper§r\n§fYour dragon species doesn't rawr, you 'Murrp'.§r\n\n§d§l§nMain Futara Dragon Features§r\n\n§f§l§nBasic Key Details§r\n§f- (OP) = Origin Primary Button§r\n§f- (OS) = Origin Secondary Button§r\n\n§f§l§nBasic Mechanic Detail§r\n§f- Use ability §7- (OP)§r\n§f- Cycle abilities §7- (OS)§r\n§f- Cycle options/settings §7- (Sneaking) + (Hold OS)§r\n§f- Ability upgrade options:§r\n§f-- Upgrade ability §7- (OP)§r\n§f-- Cycle upgrades §7- (OS)§r\n§f- Extra options:§r\n§f-- Toggle Options §7- (OP)§r\n§f-- Cycle Options §7- (OS)§r\n\n§f§l§nBasic Mechanic Detail§r\n§f- Emote§r\n§f-- Sleep §7- (Hold Sneaking)§r\n§f-- Deep Sleep §7- (Keep Hold Sneaking)§r\n§f-- Sit §7- (Sneaking) + (Sneaking) + (Sneaking)§r\n§f-- Shaking Dance §7- (Sneaking) + (Sneaking) + (Forward)§r\n§f-- Silly Dance §7- (Sneaking) + (Sneaking) + (Left)§r\n§f-- Stick Bug §7- (Sneaking) + (Sneaking) + (Right)§r\n§f-- Hug §7- (Sneaking) + (Sneaking) + (Backward)§r\n\n§f§l§nBasic Resources§r\n\n§3§lStamina [Yellow Gauge]§r\n§fUsed for special moves shown below.§r\n§fThis resource will slowly drain hunger to refill over time.§r\n§7- Required for sprinting on the ground or in liquid.§r\n§7- Required for flying.§r\n§7- Required for dashing.§r\n§7- Required for some offensive abilities.§r\n\n§3§lMana [Blue Gauge]§r\n§fUsed for some abilities that cast powerful energy.§r\n§fThis resource will slowly regenerate over time, not requiring hunger.§r\n§7- Required for casting powerful abilities.§r\n\n§3§lRage [Red Gauge]§r\n§fUsed for some abilities that get stronger the more this bar fills up.§r\n§fRage will build up when hitting enemies with compatible abilities.§r\n§fRage will slowly deplete when out of combat.§r\n§7- Some abilities change effect and gets much stronger when rage is built up.§r\n§7- If rage is gained over the maximum limit, it will regenerate stamina instead.§r\n\n§3§lUltimate [Purple Gauge]§r\n§fUsed to cast Ultimate Ability when the gauge is full.§r\n§fThe Ultimate bar will slowly fill up when hitting enemies with abilities.§r\n\n§3§lCooldown [Gray Gauge]§r\n§fShows the cooldown of movement abilities when they are on cooldown.§r\n\n§f§l§nAbility Unlock Requirements:§r\n\n§f§lMovement Abilities:§r\n§3§l[5 Level]§r\n§6§lSprint Ability [Passive Ability]§r\n§7- Sprint at very high speeds.§r\n§7- Costs stamina while sprinting.§r\n§7- Double-tab movement key or use sprint button like vanilla sprinting.§r\n§3§l[10 Level]§r\n§6§lClimb Ability [Passive Ability]§r\n§7- The ability to climb on walls like a spider while holding the sneak button.
